Hi Abhijeet,
thank you for your submission. Here are my comments and the grade.

1. Very nice documentation and well-commented code.
2. You used advanced scala features including parameterized types and self types for trait mixins. Well done!
3. Code lint does not find any major problems, only very minor warnings about type annotations.
4. Design patterns are tested and used in the implementation. Well done!
5. You use proper levels of abstraction in your design and your code is pure functional and it is cleanly written.
6. In QueryExecutor, using ??? for null will trigger runtime exception. While this hw does not require handling this, it is not a good practice to leave code like this in your submission.
7. You used external tools to measure resource consumptions. Well done.

You completed the baseline and all bonus requirements. You got 10%.

Thank you,
Mark & Aditya
